# SpringDrinksProject
Why are we doing this?

I am building a Spring Boot API that will allow users to add, read, update and delete drinks in a database. Specifically, it will be capable of handling a series of API calls using with postman.

How I expected the challenge to go

I expected the project to be straightforward but challenging. I was confident in most areas but I predicted testing to be difficult.

What went well? / What didn't go as planned?

I feel I managed time fairly well. I dedicated the first day to planning which has served me well overall. I took my time writing the code to reduce time wasted on correcting simple errors. 

I expected the project to be a challenge, especially around testing. This turned out to be correct. However, my mistakes throughout the project have served as learning experiences. Through trial and error I have gained a greater understanding of Java and Spring Boot.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project

I would like to enhance the functionality of the project by adding some custom queries and perhaps allow for PATCH requests. I would also like to add more entities to create a relational database. A long-term build could include a frontend.
